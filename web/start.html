        Finally, here’s the first complete program. It starts by printing a string, and then the date,
        using the Date class from the Java standard library.<br><br>
        <b>// HelloDate.java<br>
        import java.util.*;<br>
        public class HelloDate {<br>
         public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
         System.out.println("Hello, it’s: ");<br>
         System.out.println(new Date());<br>
         }
        }<br><br></b>

        Everything Is an Object 53<br><br>
        At the beginning of each program file, you must place any necessary import statements to
        bring in extra classes you’ll need for the code in that file. Note that I say “extra”. That’s
        because there’s a certain library of classes that are automatically brought into every Java file:
        java.lang. Start up your Web browser and look at the documentation from Sun. (If you
        haven’t downloaded the JDK documentation from http://java.sun.com, do so now.5 Note
        that this documentation doesn’t come packed with the JDK; you must do a separate
        download to get it.) If you look at the list of the packages, you’ll see all the different class
        libraries that come with Java. Select java.lang. This will bring up a list of all the classes that
        are part of that library. Since java.lang is implicitly included in every Java code file, these
        classes are automatically available. There’s no Date class listed in java.lang, which means
        you must import another library to use that. If you don’t know the library where a particular
        class is, or if you want to see all of the classes, you can select “Tree” in the Java
        documentation. Now you can find every single class that comes with Java. Then you can use
        the browser’s “find” function to find Date. When you do you’ll see it listed as
        java.util.Date, which lets you know that it’s in the util library and that you must import
        java.util.* in order to use Date.
        If you go back to the beginning, select java.lang and then System, you’ll see that the
        System class has several fields, and if you select out, you’ll discover that it’s a static
        PrintStream object. Since it’s static, you don’t need to create anything with new. The out
        object is always there, and you can just use it. What you can do with this out object is
        determined by its type: PrintStream. Conveniently, PrintStream is shown in the
        description as a hyperlink, so if you click on that, you’ll see a list of all the methods you can
        call for PrintStream. There are quite a few, and these will be covered later in the book. For
        now all we’re interested in is println( ), which in effect means “Print what I’m giving you
        out to the console and end with a newline.” Thus, in any Java program you write you can
        write something like this:<br><br>
        <b>System.out.println("A String of things");<br><br></b>
        whenever you want to display information to the console.
        The name of the class is the same as the name of the file. When you’re creating a standalone
        program such as this one, one of the classes in the file must have the same name as the file.
        (The compiler complains if you don’t do this.) That class must contain a method called
        main( ) with this signature and return type:<br><br>
        <b>public static void main(String[] args) {<br><br></b>
        The public keyword means that the method is available to the outside world (described in
        detail in the Access Control chapter). The argument to main( ) is an array of String objects.
        The args won’t be used in this program, but the Java compiler insists that they be there
        because they hold the arguments from the command line.
        The line that prints the date is quite interesting:<br><br>
        <b>System.out.println(new Date());<br><br></b>
        The argument is a Date object that is being created just to send its value (which is
        automatically converted to a String) to println( ). As soon as this statement is finished,
        that Date is unnecessary, and the garbage collector can come along and get it anytime. We
        don’t need to worry about cleaning it up.<br><br>
                                                                   
        5 The Java compiler and documentation from Sun tend to change regularly, and the best place to get them is directly from
        Sun. By downloading it yourself, you will get the most recent version.
        54 Thinking in Java Bruce Eckel<br><br>
        When you look at the JDK documentation from http://java.sun.com, you will see that
        System has many other methods that allow you to produce interesting effects (one of Java’s
        most powerful assets is its large set of standard libraries). For example:<br><br>
        <b>//: object/ShowProperties.java<br>
        public class ShowProperties {<br>
         public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
         System.getProperties().list(System.out);<br>
         System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.name"));<br>
         System.out.println(<br>
         System.getProperty("java.library.path"));<br>
         }
        } ///:~<br><br></b>
        The first line in main( ) displays all of the “properties” from the system where you are
        running the program, so it gives you environment information. The list( ) method sends the
        results to its argument, System.out. You will see later in the book that you can send the
        results elsewhere, to a file, for example. You can also ask for a specific property—in this case,
        the user name and java.library.path. (The unusual comments at the beginning and end
        will be explained a little later.)</p>
